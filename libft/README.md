# Libft

## Description
Libft is a custom C library developed as one of the core projects of the 42 curriculum.  
Its objective is to rebuild a set of essential standard C library functions, as well as create
additional utility functions that will be reused in later projects.

The project helps students:
- Understand low-level memory management
- Improve their mastery of pointers, strings, and linked lists
- Build a reliable personal library of functions for future 42 projects

Libft includes:
- Part 1: Re-implementations of libc functions (`memset`, `strlen`, `strlcpy`, etc.)
- Part 2: Additional functions for strings and memory management
- Bonus: A full set of linked list manipulation utilities

## Instructions

### Requirements
- A C compiler (42 uses `clang`)
- A Unix-like environment (Linux/macOS)
- A Makefile is provided to compile the library

### Compilation
To compile the library:
```sh
makefile
